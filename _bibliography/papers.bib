  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={Proton Transfer via Arginine with Suppressed pKa Mediates Catalysis by Gentisate and Salicylate Dioxygenase},
  author={Qian, Wang and A., Aleshintsev and K., Rai and E., Jin and R., Gupta},
  abstract={Gentisate and salicylate 1,2-dioxygenases (GDO and SDO) facilitate aerobic degradation of aromatic rings by inserting both atoms of dioxygen into their substrates, thereby participating in global carbon cycling. The role of acid–base catalysts in the reaction cycles of these enzymes is debatable. We present evidence of the participation of a proton shuffler during catalysis by GDO and SDO. The pH dependence of Michaelis–Menten parameters demonstrates that a single proton transfer is mandatory for the catalysis. Measurements at variable temperatures and pHs were used to determine the standard enthalpy of ionization (ΔHion°) of 51 kJ/mol for the proton transfer event. Although the observed apparent pKa in the range of 6.0–7.0 for substrates of both enzymes is highly suggestive of a histidine residue, ΔHion° establishes an arginine residue as the likely proton source, providing phylogenetic relevance for this strictly conserved residue in the GDO family. We propose that the atypical 3-histidine ferrous binding scaffold of GDOs contributes to the suppression of arginine pKa and provides support for this argument by employing a 2-histidine-1-carboxylate variant of the enzyme that exhibits elevated pKa. A reaction mechanism considering the role of the proton source in stabilizing key reaction intermediates is proposed.},

  abstract={Cupin dioxygenases such as salicylate 1,2-dioxygense (SDO) perform aromatic C−C bond scission via a 3-His motif tethered iron cofactor. Here, transient kinetics measurements are used to monitor the catalytic cycle of SDO by using a nitro-substituted substrate analog, 3-nitrogentisate. Compared to the natural substrate, the nitro group reduces the enzymatic kcat by 500-fold, thereby facilitating the detection and kinetic characterization of reaction intermediates. Sums and products of reciprocal relaxation times derived from kinetic measurements were found to be linearly dependent on O2 concentration, suggesting reversible formation of two distinct intermediates. Dioxygen binding to the metal cofactor takes place with a forward rate of 5.9×103 M−1 s−1: two orders of magnitude slower than other comparable ring-cleaving dioxygenses. Optical chromophore of the first intermediate is distinct from the in situ generated SDO Fe(III)−O2⋅− complex but closer to the enzyme-substrate precursor.},

  title={Calcium mediated static and dynamic allostery in S100A12: Implications for target recognition by S100 proteins},
  author={Qian Wang and C., DiForte and A., Aleshintsev and G., Elci and S., Bhattacharya and A., Bongiorno and R., Gupta},
  abstract={Structure and functions of S100 proteins are regulated by two distinct calcium binding EF hand motifs. In this work, we used solution-state NMR spectroscopy to investigate the cooperativity between the two calcium binding sites and map the allosteric changes at the target binding site. To parse the contribution of the individual calcium binding events, variants of S100A12 were designed to selectively bind calcium to either the EF-I (N63A) or EF-II (E31A) loop, respectively. Detailed analysis of the backbone chemical shifts for wildtype protein and its mutants indicates that calcium binding to the canonical EF-II loop is the principal trigger for the conformational switch between ‘closed’ apo to the ‘open’ Ca2+-bound conformation of the protein. Elimination of binding in S100-specific EF-I loop has limited impact on the calcium binding affinity of the EF-II loop and the concomitant structural rearrangement. In contrast, deletion of binding in the EF-II loop significantly attenuates calcium affinity in the EF-I loop and the structure adopts a ‘closed’ apo-like conformation. Analysis of experimental amide nitrogen (15N) relaxation rates (R1, R2, and 15N–{1H} NOE) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrate that the calcium bound state is relatively floppy with pico–nanosecond motions induced in functionally relevant domains responsible for target recognition such as the hinge domain and the C-terminal residues. Experimental relaxation studies combined with MD simulations show that while calcium binding in the EF-I loop alone does not induce significant motions in the polypeptide chain, EF-I regulates fluctuations in the polypeptide in the presence of bound calcium in the EF-II loop. These results offer novel insights into the dynamic regulation of target recognition by calcium binding and unravels the role of cooperativity between the two calcium binding events in S100A12.},

  author={Qian, Wang and D., Kuci and S., Bhattacharya and JA., Hadden‐Perilla and R., Gupta},
  abstract={Calgranulin C performs antimicrobial activity in the human immune response by sequestering Zn(II). This biological function is afforded with the aid of two structurally distinct Ca(II)-binding EF hand motifs, wherein one of which bears an unusual amino acid sequence. Here, we utilize solution state NMR relaxation measurements to investigate the mechanism of Ca(II)-modulated enhancement of Zn(II) sequestration by calgranulin C. Using C13/N15 CPMG dispersion experiments we have measured pH-dependent major and minor state populations exchanging on micro-to-millisecond timescale. This conformational exchange takes place exclusively in the Ca(II)-bound state and can be mapped to residues located in the EF-I loop and the linker between the tandem EF hands. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations spanning nano-to-microsecond timescale offer insights into the role of pH-dependent electrostatic interactions in EF-hand dynamics. Our results suggest a pH-regulated dynamic equilibrium of conformations that explore a range of “closed” and partially “open” sidechain configurations within the Zn(II) binding site. We propose a novel mechanism by which Ca(II) binding to a non-canonical EF loop regulates its flexibility and tunes the antimicrobial activity of calgranulin C.},

  author={Qian, Wang and A., Aleshintsev and AN., Jose and JM., Aramini and R., Gupta},
  abstract={Antimicrobial proteins such as S100A12 and S100A8/A9 are highly expressed and secreted by neutrophils during infection and participate in human immune response by sequestering transition metals. At neutral pH, S100A12 sequesters Zn2+ with nanomolar affinity, which is further enhanced upon calcium binding. We investigated the pH dependence of human S100A12 zinc sequestration by using Co2+ as a surrogate. Apo-S100A12 exhibits strong Co2+ binding between pH 7.0 and 10.0 that progressively diminishes as the pH is decreased to 5.3. Ca2+-S100A12 can retain nanomolar Co2+ binding up to pH 5.7. NMR spectroscopic measurements revealed that calcium binding does not alter the side-chain protonation of the Co2+/Zn2+ binding histidine residues. Instead, the calcium-mediated modulation is achieved by restraining pH-dependent conformational changes to EF loop 1, which contains Co2+/Zn2+ binding Asp25. This calcium-induced enhancement of Co2+/Zn2+ binding might assist in the promotion of antimicrobial activities in humans by S100 proteins during neutrophil activation under subneutral pH conditions.},

  abstract={S100A12 is a member of the Ca(II) binding S100 family of proteins that functions within the human innate immune system. As a metal-chelator, S100A12 binds both Ca(II) and Zn(II) at structurally distinct sites. Ca(II) binding enhances the Zn(II) binding affinity and the mechanism of the mode of action of Ca(II) is not fully understood. Here, using solution and solid state NMR spectroscopy, we have conducted structural characterization of S100A12 upon Ca(II) and Zn(II) binding. We demonstrate that distinct conformational changes are introduced in helix II and the hinge domain of the protein upon Zn(II) binding to Ca(II)-S100A12, suggesting that both ions modulate the structure of S100A12. Moreover, Ca(II)-S100A12 exhibits a broader pH range for Zn(II) binding compared to the apo protein by restricting conformational changes to Zn(II) binding residue, D25. In conclusion, our results indicate that Ca(II) stabilizes Zn(II) binding affinity by modulating structural changes. These findings will be of value for understanding of the nutrient-sequestration effect of neutrophils and the interaction between the S100A12 and other receptors such as receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR).},

  abstract={S100A12 is a member of the Ca2+ binding S100 family of proteins that functions within the human innate immune system. Zinc sequestration by S100A12 confers antimicrobial activity when the protein is secreted by neutrophils. Here, we demonstrate that Ca2+ binding to S100A12’s EF-hand motifs and Zn2+ binding to its dimeric interface cooperate to induce reversible self-assembly of the protein. Solution and magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on apo-, Ca2+-, Zn2+-, and Ca2+,Zn2+-S100A12 shows that significant metal binding-induced chemical shift perturbations, indicative of conformational changes, occur throughout the polypeptide chain. These perturbations do not originate from changes in the secondary structure of the protein, which remains largely preserved. While the overall structure of S100A12 is dominated by Ca2+ binding, Zn2+ binding to Ca2+-S100A12 introduces additional structural changes to helix II and the hinge domain (residues 38–53). The hinge domain of S100A12 is involved in the molecular interactions that promote chemotaxis for human monocyte, acute inflammatory responses and generates edema. In Ca2+-S100A12, helix II and the hinge domain participate in binding with the C-type immunoglobulin domain of the receptor for advanced glycation products (RAGE). We discuss how the additional conformational changes introduced to these domains upon Zn2+ binding may also impact the interaction of S100A12 and target proteins such as RAGE.},

  abstract={Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (AFABP: FABP4) is a member of the intracellular lipid-binding protein family that is thought to target long-chain fatty acids to nuclear receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), which in turn plays roles in insulin resistance and obesity. A molecular understanding of AFABP function requires robust isolation of the protein in liganded and free forms as well as characterization of its oligomerization state(s) under physiological conditions. We report development of a protocol to optimize the production of members of this protein family in pure form, including removal of their bound lipids by mixing with hydrophobically functionalized hydroxypropyl dextran beads and validation by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The formation of self-associated or covalently bonded protein dimers was evaluated critically using gel filtration chromatography, revealing conditions that promote or prevent formation of disulfide-linked homodimers. The resulting scheme provides a solid foundation for future investigations of AFABP interactions with key ligand and protein partners involved in lipid metabolism.},

  abstract={Gastric mucosa is one of the most vulnerable tissues in human and animal. However, little is known about the effects of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on gastric mucosa injuries induced by gastric ischemia reperfusion. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the protective effects and mechanism of CGRP on gastric mucosa injury after gastric ischemia reperfusion in rats. Thirty-six healthy Wistar rats were randomly divided into CGRP-treated, sham-operated, and control groups. Twelve rats were involved in each group. These groups were further divided into 24-h and 48-h subgroups. Gastric ischemia reperfusion injury (GI-RI) rat model was established by a 30-min celiac artery occlusion by an artery clamp, followed by 24 h or 48 h of reperfusion. CGRP (1 μg/ml) at the dose of 3 μg/kg was given intraperiloneally (IP) at the beginning of reperfusion for rats in CGRP-treated group. Saline as vehicle (3 ml/kg body weight), IP, was administered at the beginning of reperfusion for rats in control group. Sham-operated animals were subjected to an operation without GI-RI. Twenty-four hours or 48 h after operation, the samples were taken out and processed for calculating stomach mucous membrane damage index according to Guth method, detecting pathological changes of gastric mucosa tissue by light microscopy and observing the expression of gastrin (Gas) and somatostatin (SST) by immunohistochemical staining. The results showed the following: (i) gastric mucosa with diffuse edema, splinter hemorrhage and erosion, numerous endothelial cells necrosis, mucosa dissociation, and infiltration of inflammatory cells were observed in both control and CGRP-treated animals, especially in the earlier period (24 h) and then gradually healing. CGRP administration could reduce the damage of gastric mucosa. The injury index of gastric mucosa was lower in CGRP-treated group as compared with that in control group (P < 0.01). (ii) Gas expression in gastric antrum mucosa was lower in CGRP-treated group than that in control group (P < 0.01). SST expression in gastric antrum mucosa was higher in CGRP-treated group than that in control group (P < 0.01). It is concluded that CGRP regulated the secretion of Gas and SST and thus alleviated the damage of gastric mucosa induced by ischemia and reperfusion. CGRP might be a potential candidate for clinical therapy on modulating gastric mucosal protection and maintaining gastric mucosal integrity after ischemia and reperfusion of the stomach.},
